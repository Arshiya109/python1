In the context of body types, this could represent the variability in the \"cost\" or maintenance requirements for a more typical range of bodies.\n",
        "Considering the interquartile range (IQR) along with the maximum and minimum values can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cost distribution within each body type. The IQR indicates where the middle 50% of the data falls and can help identify whether the prices are tightly clustered or widely dispersed.\n",

Conversely, if a body type has a wide IQR with a significant spread between the lower and upper quartiles, it implies greater variability in prices within that category.\n",
